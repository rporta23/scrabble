Rules:
15 x 15 board
Each user gets 7 random letters from the bag. The order of players is randomized each game.
Each round, each player can choose to put a word on the board, exchange a letter, or pass.
The first player must place their first letter in the center of the board (position 7 7)
After the first player's first turn, all other words must be connected to at least one letter already on the board.
Each letter has a given point value, and after each turn, the player accumulates the number of points for each letter they played.
The symbol '~' represents a free tile. It can be any letter you choose.
If any letter of a player's word lands on a double word or triple word square (denoted by '^' and '#' respectively), 
the player's roundscore is doubled or tripled (respectively).
After each round, the program writes the round scores for all previous and current rounds
and the total score for each player into PC_PR_scoresheet.txt
Each new round, the letters used in the previous round are replaced with new random letters. 
The game continues until the "bag" runs out of letters, or until the players choose to end.
The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
